This is shop/inventory display project.
Intent was to implement shop and inventory.

The system follows basic ideas of a static shop, meaning there is already predefined set of things being sold. Due to lack of time, chores and personal things happening, I was unable to fit more, make it feel and look better.

The Inventory system was planned as a simple Item GO with a button. It is a List<Item> and is displayed in inventory. It has SellItem method that sells particular item, only if its in range of a shop.

Sadly, the requirement to make the item equippable fell short due to lack of time and inability to find proper spine characters or make and animate my own.

The player is controlled by simple controller script and have camera following it. It also has player stats script that only has currency, or gold. The HP, MP and Fame are not implemented. 

Player can move in space and collide. Only Interaction is with shopkeeper tilemap that has its own Shopkeep script.

The general idea was to keep it simple due to a short amount of time. Simple and concise. Should more time was provided, this would work far better.
